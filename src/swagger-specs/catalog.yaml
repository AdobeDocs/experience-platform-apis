  title: Catalog Service API
  description: |-
    Catalog is the system of record for data location and lineage within Adobe Experience Platform. Catalog Service does not contain the actual files or directories that contain the data. Instead, it holds the metadata and description of those files and directories.

    Catalog acts as a metadata store or "catalog" where you can find information about your data within Experience Platform.

    Use Catalog to answer the following questions: Where is my data located? At what stage of processing is this data? What systems or processes have acted on my data? What errors occurred during processing? If successful, how much data was processed?

        - [Catalog Service documentation](http://www.adobe.com/go/data-catalog-service-overview-en)

    - **Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software)**:
        - [Catalog Service API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Catalog%20Service%20API.postman_collection.json)

    - **API paths**:
        - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
        - Base path for this API: /data/foundation/catalog
        - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/catalog/batches

    - **Required headers**:
        - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
        - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
        - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).
    - **Sorting and filtering responses**:
        - When performing listing (GET) requests in the Catalog Service API, you can use query parameters to [sort and filter responses](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/catalog/api/filter-data.html).
