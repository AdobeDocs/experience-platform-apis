  title: Flow Service API - Sources
  description: >-
    Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storages, databases, and many others. The service provides a RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

    >**NOTE**: Refer to [Flow Service API - Destinations](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/destinations/) if you are looking for API documentation to perform operations on *destinations* in Experience Platform.

    - **Related documentation**:
      - [Sources documentation](https://www.adobe.com/go/sources-overview-en)

    - **Visualize API calls with Postman** (a free, third-party software):
      - [Flow Service API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Flow%20Service%20API.postman_collection.json)
      - [Video guide for creating the Postman environment](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28832)
      - [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)

    - **API paths**:
      - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
      - Base path for this API: /data/foundation/flowservice
      - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections

    - **Required headers**:
      - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
      - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
      - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#request-header-errors).

    - **Sorting and filtering responses**:
        - When performing listing (GET) requests in the Flow Service API, you can use query parameters to [sort and filter responses](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/dataflows/api/sort-and-filter.html?lang=en).

host: platform.adobe.io
basePath: /data/foundation/flowservice
tags:
  - name: Connections
    description: Base connections retain information between your source and Adobe Experience Platform. They include metadata, a partial view of the credentials used to authenticate a given source, and the unique base connection ID that corresponds to the queried connection. The base connection ID represents your authenticated connection and allows you to explore and inspect the type, structure, and contents of the data that you want to bring to Experience Platform. The base connection ID is required to create a source connection. An instance of a base connection is specific to an organization.
  - name: Connection specs 
    description: Connection specifications retain the connector properties of a given source. A connection spec can be divided into three distinct sections, authentication specifications (authSpec), source specifications (sourceSpec), and explore specifications (exploreSpec). The authSpec defines the authentication type(s) that you can use to connect your source to Experience Platform. The sourceSpec defines how you can interact with your source, including pagination types, scheduling formats, and query parameters that a given source supports. The sourceSpec also includes the schema that defines the attributes of a source. The exploreSpec defines the structure of returned data when a source is queried against. Connection specs include a connection spec ID. This ID is fixed and each source on Experience Platform has its own fixed connection spec ID. This ID is required to create a base connection and a source connection. Connection specs are organization agnostic.
  - name: Flows
    description: Flows (or dataflows) represent the transfer of data between source and target. They include details on the transformations applied to your data, the current status of your flow, and details on the most recent run iteration of your flow. Flows also contain metadata, attributes inherited from the base, source, and target connections, as well as a unique flow ID. An instance of a flow is specific to an organization.
  - name: Flow specs 
    description: Flow specs retain information that define a flow. They include information on how a flow can be scheduled, whether a flow supports options like partial ingestion and error diagnostics, as well as the parameters required for different mappings from source to target. Flow specs also include information on how a flow run can be created and a list of connection spec IDs and target connection IDs that a given flow can support. Flow specs are organization agnostic.
  - name: Runs
    description: Runs (or flow runs) represent the instance of a flow execution. For example, if a flow is scheduled to run hourly at 9 AM, 10 AM, and 11 AM, then you would have three instances of a run. Runs retain metric summaries on your flow executions, including information on the duration of the run, size of the data, file count, and a status update. An instance of a run is specific to an organization.
  - name: Source connections
    description: Source connections represent the incoming data from a given source. Source connections define where the data is coming from and in what format. Source connections also refer to the base connection for authentication information. For file-based sources like cloud storages, source connections can define additional information on the data transfer, such as column delimiter, encoding type, compression type, regular expressions, and whether ingestion is to be done recursively. An instance of a source connection is specific to an organization.
  - name: Target connections
    description: Target connections represent the outgoing data from a source to a location such as Experience Platform or the data lake. Target connections contain information on your schema, dataset, and the destination of your data. Target connections also include a unique target connection ID that is required in order to create a flow. An instance of a target connection is specific to an organization.

              - **name** - **(Required)** The name assigned to the transformation.
              - **params** - **(Required)** Contains information about the transformation that will be completed. Sources categorized as either CRM or relational database require the use of the "deltaColumn" param. Other categories do not.
              
            - **scheduleParams** - **(Required)** Contains information regarding the ingestion scheduling of the flow.
              - **startTime** - Designates the start time for flow in epoch time in seconds.
              - **frequency** - Designates the scheduled frequency of ingestion for a flow. Valid values include once, minute, hour, day, week.
              - **interval** - Designates the period between two consecutive flow runs. Its assigned value should be a non zero integer. Interval is not required when frequency is set as once, and should be set as equal or greater than 15 if frequency is set on a per minute basis. There are no constraints on interval for other frequency settings.
              - **backfill** - A boolean value that determines what data is initially ingested. If backfill is enabled, all current files in the specified path will be ingested during the first scheduled ingestion. If backfill is disabled, only the files that are loaded in between the first run of ingestion and the Start time will be ingested. Files loaded prior to Start time will not be ingested.
