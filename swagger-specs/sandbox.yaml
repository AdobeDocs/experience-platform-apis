  title: Sandbox API
  description: |-
    Adobe Experience Platform provides virtual sandbox environments which provide isolation and access control for Platform integrations. Use sandboxes for application lifecycle management, project management, and to build customized development ecosystems.
    - **Related documentation**:
        - [Sandbox documentation](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en)

    - **Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software)**:
        - [Sandbox API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Sandbox%20API.postman_collection.json)
        - [Video guide for creating the Postman environment](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28832)
        - [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/using_environments_in_collection_runs/)

    - **API paths**:
        - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
        - Base path for this API: /data/foundation/sandbox-management
        - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/sandbox-management/sandboxes

    - **Required headers**:
        - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
        - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
        - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).        

    - **Filtering responses**:
        - When performing listing (GET) requests in the Sandbox API, you can use query parameters to [filter responses](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sandbox/api/appendix.html#query).

Get your [authentication credentials](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-get-credentials-en) and use the **Try it** functionality in the right rail. Note that by using this functionality, you are making real API calls. Keep this in mind when you interact with production sandboxes.
