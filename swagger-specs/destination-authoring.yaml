    Adobe Experience Platform Destination SDK (also referred to as the *Destination Authoring API*) is a suite of configuration APIs that allow you to configure destination integration patterns for Experience Platform to deliver audience and profile data to your endpoint, based on data and authentication formats of your choice. 
    
    - **Related documentation**:
        - [Destination SDK overview](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-overview-en)
        - [Getting started](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-getting-started-en)

    - **Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software)**:
        - [Destination Authoring API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Destination%20Authoring%20API.postman_collection.json)

        - [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)

    - **API paths**:
        - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io
        - Base path for this API: /data/core/activation/authoring
        - Example of a complete path for making a call to "/destinations": https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/core/activation/authoring/destinations
  
    - **Required headers**:
        - All service calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
        - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
        - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#request-header-errors).

  - name: (NEW) Interactive API documentation
    description: You can now interact with the Experience Platform API endpoints directly from this API reference page. Get your [authentication credentials](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-get-credentials-en) and use the **Try it** functionality in the right rail. Note that by using this functionality, you are making real API calls. Keep this in mind when you interact with production sandboxes.
  - name: "Destination configurations"
    description: "Destination configurations contain essential metadata for individual destinations, including their name, category, description, and more. The settings in this configuration also determine how Experience Platform users authenticate to your destination, how it appears in the Experience Platform user interface, and the identities that can be exported to your destination. <br><br> For a description of the functionality supported by this endpoint and an example configuration, see the overview on [destination configurations](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-destination-configuration-en) in the Destination SDK documentation."
  - name: "Destination servers and templates"
    description: "Destination server configurations contain information about the server receiving the messages (the server on your side). Template configurations allow you to configure how to format the exported message to your destination. <br><br> For a description of the functionality provided by this endpoint, see the overview on [server and template specs](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-server-template-configuration-en) in the Destination SDK documentation."
  - name: "Audience metadata templates"
    description: "Audience metadata templates allow you to programmatically manage audiences in your destination. <br><br> For a description of when to use this endpoint, see the overview on [audience metadata management](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-audience-metadata-en) in the Destination SDK documentation."
  - name: "Credentials"
    description: "If a Platform customer does not need to provide any authentication credentials to connect to your destination, a credentials configuration can provide the required credentials instead. Note that you must also select `PLATFORM_AUTHENTICATION` in the destination configuration in order to make use of this endpoint. <br><br> For more information when to use this endpoint, see the overview on [authentication configuration](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-authentication-configuration-en) in the Destination SDK documentation. "
  - name: "Destination testing"
    description: "The Destination Authoring API provides several tools for testing a destination: [Generate sample profiles](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-generate-profiles-en), [generate sample templates](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-create-template-en), [perform calls to your destination](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-test-destination-en)."
  - name: "Destination publishing"
    description: "After you have configured and tested your destination, you can use the destination publishing endpoint to submit it to Adobe for review and publishing. Read more in the [destination publishing API tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/destination-sdk-publish-en)."
