The value must be an array that contains one or more of a comma-separated list of properties (for example: `?property=action==create,assetType==Sandbox`). If multiple values for the `property` parameter are provided, then all filters must match in order for an event to be returned. Only the last 10,000 records are displayed irrespective of the various filters selected.\n\nThe properties that can be used for filtering are `timestamp`, `status`, `action`, `user`, and `assetType`.\n\nWhen filtering by `timestamp`, it is best practice to use a range using `>` and `<` operators rather than an exact value. For example: `?property=timestamp<2020-02-08T02:46:48.610862Z&property=timestamp>2020-01-01T02:46:48.610862Z`.\n\nIf you want to filter results using multiple values for a single filter, pass in a comma-separated list of values. For example, `property=action==create,update` returns audit events whose `action` property is either `create` or `update`.",
