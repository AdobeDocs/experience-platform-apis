  title: Privacy Service API
  description: |-
    Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service provides a common, centralized facilitation of access/delete requests and opt-out-of-sale requests for private data on Adobe Experience Cloud applications. The service includes a UI for selecting and creating requests, a business layer that processes incoming and outgoing traffic, a data store for audit and logging information, and temporary storage for data retrieval while requests are pending or waiting to be viewed.
    Use the Privacy Service API to create or manage privacy jobs to access or delete user information, manage opt-out requests, and more. - **Related documentation**:
      - [Privacy Service documentation](http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy-overview-en)

    - **Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software)**:

    - **API paths**:
      - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
      - Base path for this API: /data/core/privacy
      - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/core/privacy/jobs

    - **Required headers**:
      - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the guide on [getting started with the Privacy Service API](http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy-getting-started-en).
      - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).
