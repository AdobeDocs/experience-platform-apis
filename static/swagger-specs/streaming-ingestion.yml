  title: Streaming Ingestion API
  description: |-
    Streaming ingestion allows you to send data from client and server-side devices to 
    Experience Platform in real time. Platform supports the use of data inlets to stream 
    incoming experience data, which is persisted in streaming-enabled datasets within the 
    data lake. Data inlets can be configured to automatically authenticate the data they 
    collect, ensuring that the data is coming from a trusted source.

    - **Required headers**:
      - All calls require `Content-Type` and `x-sandbox-name`. Authorized/authenticated accounts will need the 
      `Authorization` header. For more information on how to obtain the `Authorization` value, see the 
      [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).
