  title: Flow Service API - Sources
  description: |-
    Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storages, databases, and many others. The service provides a RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.
    >**NOTE**: Refer to [Flow Service API - Destinations](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/destinations/) if you are looking for API documentation to perform operations on *destinations* in Experience Platform.
    - **Related documentation**:
      - [Sources documentation](https://www.adobe.com/go/sources-overview-en)

    - **Visualize API calls with Postman** (a free, third-party software):
      - [Flow Service API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Flow%20Service%20API.postman_collection.json)
      - [Video guide for creating the Postman environment](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28832)
      - [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)

    - **API paths**:
      - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
      - Base path for this API: /data/foundation/flowservice
      - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections

    - **Required headers**:
      - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
      - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
      - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#request-header-errors). You can also view a list of [common Flow Service error messages](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/errors/flow-service-errors.html) and resolution suggestions.

    - **Sorting and filtering responses**:
        - When performing listing (GET) requests in the Flow Service API, you can use query parameters to [sort and filter responses](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/dataflows/api/sort-and-filter.html?lang=en).

  description: You can now interact with the Experience Platform API endpoints directly from this API reference page. Get your [authentication credentials](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en) and use the **Try it** functionality in the right rail. Note that by using this functionality, you are making real API calls. Keep this in mind when you interact with production sandboxes.
- name: Connections
  description: "Base connections retain information between your source and Adobe Experience Platform. They include metadata, a partial view of the credentials used to authenticate a given source, and the unique base connection ID that corresponds to the queried connection. The base connection ID is required to create a source connection. The base connection ID represents your authenticated connection and allows you to explore and inspect the type, structure, and contents of the data that you want to bring to Experience Platform. An instance of a base connection is specific to an organization."
- name: Connection specs
  description: "Connection specifications retain the connector properties of a given source. A connection spec can be divided into three distinct sections, authentication specifications (authSpec), source specifications (sourceSpec), and explore specifications (exploreSpec). The authSpec defines the authentication type(s) that you can use to connect your source to Experience Platform. The sourceSpec consists of source connection parameters that a given source requires from a user. For example, the sourceSpec of a cloud storage source can require a user to provide values for path or recursive parameter. The sourceSpec also includes properties that are used when the source is displayed in the Platform UI catalog. The exploreSpec defines the structure of returned data when a source is queried against. Connection specs include a connection spec ID. This ID is fixed and each source on Experience Platform has its own fixed connection spec ID. This ID is required to create a base connection and a source connection. Connection specs are organization agnostic."
- name: Flows
  description: "Flows (or dataflows) represent the transfer of data between source and target. They include details on the transformations applied to your data, the current status of your flow, and details on the most recent run iteration of your flow. Flows also contain metadata, attributes inherited from the base, source, and target connections, as well as a unique flow ID. An instance of a flow is specific to an organization."
- name: Flow specs
  description: "Flow specs retain information that define a flow. They include information on how a flow can be scheduled, whether a flow supports options like partial ingestion and error diagnostics, as well as the parameters required for different mappings from source to target. Flow specs also include information on how a flow run can be created and a list of connection spec IDs and target connection IDs that a given flow can support. Flow specs are organization agnostic."
- name: Runs
  description: "Runs (or flow runs) represent the instance of a flow execution. For example, if a flow is scheduled to run hourly at 9 AM, 10 AM, and 11 AM, then you would have three instances of a run. Runs retain metric summaries on your flow executions, including information on the duration of the run, size of the data, file count, and a status update. An instance of a run is specific to an organization."
- name: Source connections
  description: "Source connections represent the incoming data from a given source. Source connections define the source and the format of the incoming data. Source connections also refer to the base connection for authentication information. For file-based sources like cloud storages, source connections can define additional information on the data transfer, such as column delimiter, encoding type, compression type, regular expressions, and whether ingestion is to be done recursively. For table-based sources such as CRMs and databases, source connections can be used for additional attributes such as `tableName` and `column`. An instance of a source connection is specific to an organization."
- name: Target connections
  description: "Target connections represent the outgoing data from a source to a location such as Experience Platform or the data lake. Target connections contain information on your schema, dataset, and the destination of your data. Target connections also include a unique target connection ID that is required in order to create a flow. An instance of a target connection is specific to an organization."
