  title: Sandbox API
  description: |-
    Adobe Experience Platform provides virtual sandbox environments which provide isolation and access control for Platform integrations. Use sandboxes for application lifecycle management, project management, and to build customized development ecosystems. Use sandbox tooling to seamlessly export and import sandbox configurations between sandboxes through the use of packages.
    - **Related documentation**:
        - [Sandbox documentation](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en)
        - [Sandbox tooling documentation](http://adobe.com/go/sandbox-tooling-en)

    - **Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software)**:
        - [Sandbox API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Sandbox%20API.postman_collection.json)
        - [Video guide for creating the Postman environment](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28832)
        - [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/using_environments_in_collection_runs/)

    - **API paths**:
        - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
        - Base path for the sandbox API: /data/foundation/sandbox-management
        - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/sandbox-management/sandboxes
        - Base path for the sandbox tooling API: /data/foundation/exim
        - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/exim/packages

    - **Required headers**:
        - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
        - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
        - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).        

    - **Filtering responses**:
        - When performing listing (GET) requests in the Sandbox API, you can use query parameters to filter responses. Refer to the [Sandbox API queries](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sandbox/api/appendix.html#query) or the [Sandbox tooling API queries](http://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sandbox/sandbox-tooling-api/appendix) for a list of available queries.

Get your [authentication credentials](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-get-credentials-en) and use the **Try it** functionality in the right rail. Note that by using this functionality, you are making real API calls. Keep this in mind when you interact with production sandboxes.
