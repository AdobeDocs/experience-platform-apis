    Use the Adobe Experience Platform Query Service API to query Platform data with standard SQL. With this serverless tool, you can join any datasets in the [Experience Platform Data Lake](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/license/data-management-best-practices.html#understanding-adobe-experience-platform-data-storage) and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-time Customer Profile.

    **API paths**:
      * PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
      * Base path for this API: /data/foundation/query
      * Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/query/queries

    **Required headers**:
      * All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
      * All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
      * All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    **API error handling**:
      * Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#request-header-errors).

Get your [authentication credentials](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-get-credentials-en) and use the **Try it** functionality in the right rail. Note that by using this functionality, you are making real API calls. Keep this in mind when you interact with production sandboxes.

        description: "Comma-separated filters. Multiple filters separated by commas can be passed. The examples below are given with unsafe
          HTML characters for clarity, but all content MUST be HTML escaped.\n\n\

          The following list of properties allow filtering with all operators: `created`,
          `updated`, `state`, `id`.\n\n\
          
          The following is a list of supported operators: `>` (greater than)
          `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to)
          `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `~` (contains)\n\n\

          Examples with filters that support all operators:\n 
          * Get query with a match on id:\n 
          `id==6ebd9c2d-494d-425a-aa91-24033f3abeec`\n 
          * Get queries created after a given timestamp, and with a specific state:\n 
          `created>=2017-04-05T13:30:00Z,state==IN_PROGRESS`\n
          Filtering is also allowed with limited operators on the following properties:\n
          * The `referenced_datasets` and `userId` property. This filter only allows
          the `==` equal to operator, and up to 10 dataset IDs can be included by
          using the `||` logical OR operator. \n 
          Example: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff`\n
          * The SQL property. This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`),
          and only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n 
          Example: `sql~SELECT c1`\n 
          * the `templateId` property: This filter only allows the
          equal to operator (`==`), and only one template ID can be included.\n
          Example: `templateId=3e61c592-05de-422e-99be-24712c07fc29`\n
          * the `templateName` property: This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`),
          and only one templateName can be included.\n
          Example: `templateName~sample-template-name` \n
          * The `client` property. This filter only allows the `==` equal to operator, and
          only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n
          Example: `client==API`\n
          * The `scheduleId` and `scheduleRunId` properties. These filters only allow
          the `==` equal to operator.\n
          Example: `scheduleId==bWFudWFsX18yMDE4LTEwLTEyVDA0OjM2OjE5LjkzNzI2Nw==,scheduleRunId==manual__2018-10-12T05:11:40.816520`\n
          Example of a complex search with multiple filters:\n 
          * Get me queries that utilize two specific datasets, submitted by a particular user, and
          that include the string `SELECT c1` in the SQL body: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff,userId=1234@AdobeId,sql~SELECTc1`"
