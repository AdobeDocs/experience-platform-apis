  title: Reactor API
  description: |-
    Use the Reactor API to programmatically manage resources and develop tag extensions in Adobe Experience Platform.
    **Related documentation**:
      * [Tags overview and UI documentation](https://adobe.com/go/launch_help_en)
      * [Reactor API guides](https://adobe.com/go/reactor-api-overview)

    **API paths**:
      * Reactor Gateway URL: https://<span>reactor.adobe.io
      * Example of a complete path for making a call to `/properties`: https://<span>reactor.adobe.io/properties

    **Required headers**:
      * All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/launch-authentication-en).
      * All GET requests to the Reactor API require an `Accept` header to determine what data is returned by the system. In most cases, this value will be `application/vnd.api+json;revision=#` (where `#` is the revision number of the resource you want to retrieve, e.g. `1`).
      * All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type`. The specific `Content-Type` value for each call is provided in the parameters sections in the endpoints listed below.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).

- name: (NEW) Interactive API documentation
  description: You can now interact with the Experience Platform API endpoints directly from this API reference page. Get your [authentication credentials](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en) and use the **Try it** functionality in the right rail. Note that by using this functionality, you are making real API calls. Keep this in mind when you interact with production sandboxes.
- name: Companies
  description: "A company represents the organization of a tags user, typically a business. These companies match 1:1 with IMS Organization IDs. API users will only have visibility into the companies to which they have access. Nearly all API usage is performed using an Adobe I/O integration which is scoped to a single IMS Org, and therefore the /companies endpoint is not a major part of most workflows. Most use cases start with a property instead."
- name: Properties
  description: "A property is a container that holds most of the other resources available within the Reactor API. The only resources that are not owned by a property are audit events, companies, extension packages, and profiles. A property belongs to exactly one company, and a company can have many properties."
- name: Data elements
  description: "A data element functions as a variable which points to an important piece of data within your application. Data elements are used within rules and extension configurations. When the rule is triggered at runtime in a browser or an application, the value of the data element is resolved and used within the rule."
- name: Rules
  description: "Rules control the behavior of the resources contained in a deployed library. A rule is a group of one or more rule components, and exists to tie the rule components together in a logical way."
- name: Rule components
  description: "Rule components are the individual items that make up a rule. Rule components have three basic types: events (what triggers a rule), conditions (what the rule checks to determine an action), and actions (what the rule executes depending on whether the condition is met). A rule component can **only** belong to exactly one rule."
- name: Extension packages
  description: "An extension package represents a grouping of individual capabilities that can be made available to a tags user. Most commonly, these capabilities come in the form of rule components (events, conditions, and actions) and data elements, but can also include main modules and shared modules. The capabilities provided by an extension package are installed as an extension when it is included in a library."
- name: Extension package usage authorization
  description: "An extension package usage authorization is an authorization granted by the package owner to other companies for the private use of the extension package versions."
- name: Extensions
  description: An extension represents the installed instance of an extension package. An extension makes the features defined by an extension package available to a property. These features are leveraged when creating data elements and rule components.
- name: Libraries
  description: "A library is a collection of resources (extensions, rules, and data elements) that represent the desired behavior of a property. Libraries are compiled into builds, and those builds are assigned to different environments as they move down the publishing flow from testing to production."
- name: Builds
  description: "A tag library is compiled into a build in order for it to be assigned to an environment for testing and deployment. The contents of a build varies depending on the resources included in the library, the configuration of the environment to which the build is assigned, and the platform of the property that the build belongs to."
- name: Environments
  description: "An environment indicates the specific host where a build can be deployed, and whether the build should be deployed as a set of files or compressed in an archive format. In the Reactor API, environments are separate from hosts themselves, which are managed by the /hosts endpoint."
- name: Hosts
  description: A host represents a hosted destination where a library build can be delivered and ultimately deployed. Hosts can be either Akamai or SFTP servers.
- name: Secrets
  description: A secret is a resource that represents an authentication credential. Secrets are used in event forwarding to authenticate to another system for secure data exchange. Secrets can only be created within event forwarding properties (properties whose `platform` attribute is set to `edge`).
- name: App configurations
  description: App configurations allow credentials to be stored and retrieved for later use.
- name: Audit events
  description: "An audit event is a record of a specific change to another tag resource, generated at the time the change is made. These are system events which can be subscribed to through the use of a callback function."
- name: Callbacks
  description: A callback is a message that Platform sends to a URL host whenever a new audit event is generated.
- name: Notes
  description: "Notes are textual annotations that you can add to certain tag resources, such as data elements, extensions, libraries, properties, rules, and rule components."
- name: Profiles
  description: "A profile represents a tags user. Platform does not maintain its own database of users and permissions, and instead relies on Adobe IDs managed by Adobe’s company-wide Identity Management System (IMS). A profile contains all the information about the logged-in user, including all the Adobe Orgs to which they belong, the product profiles they belong to within each Org, and the rights they have from each product profile."
- name: Search
  description: "The search endpoint provides a way to find resources matching a desired criteria, expressed as a query. All queries are scoped to your current company and accessible properties."

        When updating a data element, its ID must be provided in both the request path and the request payload. These IDs must match in order for the call to be successful.

        You can also create a new revision of the data element which is assigned its own ID. The original data element may be discovered via the origin link. Revising a data element is achieved by supplying a `meta` attribute containing an `action` property with the value `revise`. Excluding this property will update the current revision of the data element without creating a new one.

        This call tests or retries a secret depending on the value of the `meta.action` property in the request payload. This call does not update the secret itself.


        You can retry a secret by setting the `action` property to `retry`. Retrying a secret is the action of manually triggering the secret exchange.


        If the secret in question is an `oauth2` type, you can test it by setting the `action` property to `test` instead. This performs an exchange with the authorization service and includes the response in the `test_exchange` attribute in the secret’s `meta` object.

      summary: Update a library
      description: |-
        This endpoint allows you to update the name of a library, or transition the library between different states in the [publishing flow](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/publish/publishing-flow.html).

        When updating a library, its ID must be provided in both the request path and the request payload. These IDs must match in order for the call to be successful.

        To transition the library between states, the payload must include a `meta` object, containing a single `action` property whose value represents the specific transition action. The available actions for a library depend on its current publishing state. See the API guide on [transitioning a library](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/api/endpoints/libraries.html#transition) for details on the available actions for each library state.

        To update the name of a library, the payload must include an `attributes` object, containing a single `name` property with the updated value.

        >**NOTE**: For more information on using this operation, see the [libraries endpoint guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/api/endpoints/libraries.html) on Experience League.

        When updating a rule, you have the option of creating a new revision of the rule which is assigned its own ID. The original rule may be discovered via the origin link. Revising a rule is achieved by supplying a `meta` attribute containing an `action` property with the value `revise`. Excluding this property will update the current revision of the rule without creating a new one.

        When updating or revising a rule, its ID must be provided in both the request path and the request payload. These IDs must match in order for the call to be successful.

In this case, the value for the attribute would be `upstream_changed`.

                  Some extension developers prefer hosting all tags-related files on their own server. This provides an increased level of certainty regarding file availability at runtime and allows you to easily scan the code for security vulnerabilities. If the library portion of your extension needs to load JavaScript files at runtime, it is recommended you use this property to list those files. The listed files will be hosted alongside the tag runtime library. Your extension can then load the files via a URL retrieved using the [getHostedLibFileUrl](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extension-dev/turbine.html?lang=en#get-hosted-lib-file) method.


                  This property provides a list of relative paths to third-party library files that need to be hosted.
