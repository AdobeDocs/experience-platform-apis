  title: Policy Service API
  description: |-
    Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance simplifies and streamlines the process of categorizing data and creating data usage policies. Once data labels have been applied and data usage policies are in place, marketing actions can be evaluated to ensure the correct use of data.

    Use the Policy Service API to programmatically manage data usage labels, policies, and marketing actions. The API also provides endpoints to evaluate marketing actions against specific data usage labels to test for policy violations.

    Note: You can use the [Dataset Service API](./dataset-service.yaml) to manage data usage labels for an existing dataset.

    - **API paths**:
      - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
      - Base path for this API: /data/foundation/dulepolicy
      - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dulepolicy/labels/custom

    - **Required headers**:
      - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
      - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
      - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).

        This call returns a set of constraints that would govern an attempt to perform the given marketing action on an existing data source in Platform. The source data (typically a dataset) is specified by the `entityType` and `entityId` of the elements in the request body. In the case of a dataset entity, a set of fields may also be specified in the `entityMeta` to indicate that only those fields from that dataset should be used in the evaluation. The returned constraints take the form of a set of policies that would be violated by attempting the marketing action on the dataset(s) and/or field(s).

        You can also evaluate a marketing action based on a defined set of usage labels instead of testing against an actual data source. See the GET method for this endpoint for more information.

        This call returns a set of constraints that would govern an attempt to perform the given marketing action on an existing data source in Platform. The source data (typically a dataset) is specified by the "entityType" and "entityId" of the elements in the request body. In the case of a dataset entity, a set of fields may also be specified in the "entityMeta" to indicate that only those fields from that dataset should be used in the evaluation. The returned constraints take the form of a set of policies that would be violated by attempting the marketing action on the dataset(s) and/or field(s).

        You can also evaluate a marketing action based on a defined set of usage labels instead of testing against an actual data source. See the GET method for this endpoint for more information.
