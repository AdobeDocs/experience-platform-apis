  title: Dataset Service API
  description: |-
    Use the several endpoints provided by The Dataset Service API to manage data usage labels for existing datasets within the Data Lake. Data usage labels are part of Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance, which allows you to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data use. Dataset Service is separate from Catalog Service, which manages other dataset metadata.

    - **API paths**:
        - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
        - Base path for this API: /data/foundation/dataset
        - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dataset/datasets/5abd49645591445e1ba04f87/labels

    - **Required headers**:
        - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
        - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
        - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).
