  title: Data Prep API
  description: |-
    Data Prep allows data engineers to map, transform, and validate data to and from Experience Data Model (XDM). Use the Data Prep API to programmatically create mapping sets and functions, and transform your data between source and destination schemas.
    - Related documentation:
      - [Data Prep documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-prep/home.html)

    - **API paths**:
      - Platform Gateway URL: https://<spam>platform.adobe.io/
      - Base path for this API: /data/foundation/conversation
      - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/conversion/languages/el/functions

    - **Required headers**:
        - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
        - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
        - All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
        - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).

Get your [authentication credentials](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en) and use the **Try it** functionality in the right rail. Note that by using this functionality, you are making real API calls. Keep this in mind when you interact with production sandboxes.
