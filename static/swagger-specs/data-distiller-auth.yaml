  title: Data Distiller Authorization API
  description: |-
    Use the Adobe Experience Platform Data Distiller Authorization API to manage IP-based access restrictions for Query Service by controlling which IP addresses are allowed. With this tool, you can configure, enforce, and monitor IP-based restrictions to meet stringent security standards within Adobe Experience Platform.

    NOTE: This functionality is only available to customers who have purchased the Data Distiller add on. For more information, contact your Adobe representative.

    **Related Documentation**:
      * [Data Distiller Authorization API documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/auth-api/overview)

    **API paths**:
      * PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
      * Base path for this API: /data/foundation/query/security
      * Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/query/security/ip-access

    **Required headers**:
      * All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on obtaining these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
      * All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` specifying the lowercase sandbox name where the operation will take place (for example, "prod"). For more details, see the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en).
      * All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` set to `application/json`.

    **API error handling**:
      * Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).
      * Refer to the IP Allow List documentation for [guidance on configuring allowed IP ranges](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/ip-address-allowlist) and resolving common configuration issues.
