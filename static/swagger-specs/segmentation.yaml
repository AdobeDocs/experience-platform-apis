  title: Segmentation Service API
  description: >- 

    Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service provides a user interface and RESTful API that allows you to create audiences through segment definitions or other sources from your Real-Time Customer Profile data. These audiences are centrally configured and maintained on Platform, and are readily accessible by any Adobe solution. Use the Segmentation Service API to programmatically integrate the service's various functionalities into your experience application, providing RESTful endpoints for managing audiences, segment definitions, segment jobs, exports, schedules, and more.

    - **API paths**: 
      - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/
      - Base path for this API: /data/core/ups
      - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/definitions

    - **Required headers**:
      - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
      - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, \"prod\"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en)for more information.    
      - All requests with a payload in the request body(such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

    - **API error handling**:
      - Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#request-header-errors).

          - **fields** - [Optional] Column filters (comma-separated list of columns in dot notation). Limits the data fields to be included in the export to only those provided in this parameter. The same parameter is also available when creating a segment definition, therefore the fields in the segment definition may have already been filtered. Omitting this value will result in all fields being included in the exported data.
          - **mergePolicy** - [Optional] Specifies the merge policy to govern the exported data. Include this parameter when there are multiple segment definitions being exported. Omitting this value will cause the Export Service to use the merge policy provided by the segmentId or snapshotName.
              - **id** - The ID of the merge policy.
              - **version** - The specific version of the merge policy to use. Omitting this value will default to the most recent version.
          - **filter** - [Optional] Specifies one or more of the following filters to apply to the segment definition before export.
              - **segments** - [Optional] Specifies the segment definitions to export. Omitting this value will result in all data from all profiles being exported. Accepts an array of segment definitions, each containing the following fields:
                  - **segmentId** - **[Required if specifying segment definitions]** Segment definition ID for profiles to be exported.
                  - **segmentNs** - [Optional] The namespace of the segment definition for the given segmentId.
                  - **status** - [Optional] An array of strings providing a status filter for the `segmentID`. By default, `status` will have the value `["realized", "existing"]` which represents all profiles that fall into the segment definition at the current time. Possible values include: `"realized"`, `"existing"`, and `"exited"`.
              - **segmentQualificationTime** - [Optional] Filter based on segment qualification time. The start time and/or end time can be provided.
                  - **startTime** - [Optional] Segment qualification start time for a segment definition ID for a given status. It not provided, there will be no filter on the start time for a segment definition ID qualification. The timestamp must be provided in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.
                  - **endTime** - [Optional] Segment qualification end time for a segment definition ID for a given status. It not provided, there will be no filter on the end time for a segment definition ID qualification. The timestamp must be provided in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.
              - **fromIngestTimestamp** - [Optional] Filters the resulting profiles to those that have been updated after the provided timestamp. Value is provided in RFC 3339 format. Supports `greater_than` operand.
              - **emptyProfiles** - [Optional] Boolean. Profiles can contain Profile records, ExperienceEvent records, or both. Profiles with no Profile records and only ExperienceEvent records are referred to as "emptyProfiles". To export all profiles in the Profile store, including the "emptyProfiles", set the value of "emptyProfiles" to `true`. If "emptyProfiles" is set to `false`, only profiles with Profile records in the store are exported. By default, if "emptyProfiles" attribute is not included, only profiles containing Profile records are exported.
          - **additionalFields** - [Optional] Additional profile fields that need to be exported.
              - **eventList** - Used if ExperienceEvents need to be exported with profiles.
                  - **fields** - Comma-separated list of ExperienceEvent fields to be included in the export. If not provided, all ExperienceEvent fields are exported.
                  - **filter** - Filters ExperienceEvents based on the parameters below. If not provided, all events corresponding to the resulting profiles will be exported.
                      - **fromIngestTimestamp** - Filters ExperienceEvents to those that have been updated after the provided timestamp. This is not the event time itself but the ingestion time for the events. Value is provided in RFC 3339 format.
          - **destination** - **[Required]** Destination information for the exported data.
              - **datasetId** - **[Required]** The ID of the dataset where data is to be exported.
              - **segmentPerBatch** [Optional] A Boolean value that, if not provided, defaults to false. A value of false exports all segment definition IDs into a single batch ID. A value of true exports one segment definition ID into one batch ID.
          - **schema.name** - **[Required]** The name of the schema associated with the dataset where data is to be exported.
