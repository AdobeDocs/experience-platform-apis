The value must be an array that contains one or more of a comma-separated list of properties (for example: `?property=action==create,assetType==Sandbox`). If multiple values for the `property` parameter are provided, then all filters must match in order for an event to be returned. Only the last 10,000 records are displayed irrespective of the various filters selected.\n\nThe properties that can be used for filtering are `timestamp`, `status`, `action`, `user`, and `assetType`.\n\nWhen filtering by `timestamp`, it is best practice to use a range using `>` and `<` operators rather than an exact value. For example: `?property=timestamp<2020-02-08T02:46:48.610862Z&property=timestamp>2020-01-01T02:46:48.610862Z`.\n\nIf you want to filter results using multiple values for a single filter, pass in a comma-separated list of values. For example, `property=action==create,update` returns audit events whose `action` property is either `create` or `update`.",

Each action recorded in a log contains metadata that indicates the action type, date and time, the email ID of the user who performed the action, and additional attributes relevant to the action type.\n\nUse the Audit Query API to programmatically view and export audit logs recorded by the system.\n- Related documentation:\n    - [Audit logs overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/governance-privacy-security/audit-logs/overview.html)\n\n- **Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software)**:\n    - [Audit Query API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Audit%20Query%20API.postman_collection.json)\n    - [Video guide for creating the Postman environment](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28832)\n    - [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)\n  \n- **API paths**:\n    - PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/\n    - Base path for this API: /data/foundation\n    - Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/audit/events\n\n- **Required headers**:\n    - All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).\n    - All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, \"prod\").
