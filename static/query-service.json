The examples below are given with unsafe HTML characters for clarity, but all content MUST be HTML escaped.\n\nThe following list of properties allow filtering with all operators: `created`, `updated`, `state`, `id`.\n\nThe following is a list of supported operators: `>` (greater than) `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to) `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `~` (contains)\n\nExamples with filters that support all operators:\n  * Get query with a match on id:\n  `id==6ebd9c2d-494d-425a-aa91-24033f3abeec`\n  * Get queries created after a given timestamp, and with a specific state:\n  `created>=2017-04-05T13:30:00Z,state==IN_PROGRESS`\n Filtering is also allowed with limited operators on the following properties:\n * The `referenced_datasets` and `userId` property. This filter only allows the `==` equal to operator, and up to 10 dataset IDs can be included by using the `||` logical OR operator. \n  Example: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff`\n * The SQL property. This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`), and only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n  Example: `sql~SELECT c1`\n  * the `templateId` property: This filter only allows the equal to operator (`==`), and only one template ID can be included.\n Example: `templateId=3e61c592-05de-422e-99be-24712c07fc29`\n * the `templateName` property: This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`), and only one templateName can be included.\n Example: `templateName~sample-template-name` \n * The `client` property. This filter only allows the `==` equal to operator, and only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n Example: `client==API`\n * The `scheduleId` and `scheduleRunId` properties. These filters only allow the `==` equal to operator.\n Example: `scheduleId==bWFudWFsX18yMDE4LTEwLTEyVDA0OjM2OjE5LjkzNzI2Nw==,scheduleRunId==manual__2018-10-12T05:11:40.816520`\n Example of a complex search with multiple filters:\n  * Get me queries that utilize two specific datasets, submitted by a particular user, and that include the string `SELECT c1` in the SQL body: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff,userId=1234@AdobeId,sql~SELECTc1`",

The examples below are given with unsafe HTML characters for clarity, but all content MUST be HTML escaped.\n\nThe following list of properties allow filtering with all operators: `created`, `updated`, `state`, `id`.\n\nThe following is a list of supported operators: `>` (greater than) `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to) `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `~` (contains)\n\nExamples with filters that support all operators:\n  * Get query with a match on id:\n  `id==6ebd9c2d-494d-425a-aa91-24033f3abeec`\n  * Get queries created after a given timestamp, and with a specific state:\n  `created>=2017-04-05T13:30:00Z,state==IN_PROGRESS`\n Filtering is also allowed with limited operators on the following properties:\n * The `referenced_datasets` and `userId` property. This filter only allows the `==` equal to operator, and up to 10 dataset IDs can be included by using the `||` logical OR operator. \n  Example: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff`\n * The SQL property. This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`), and only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n  Example: `sql~SELECT c1`\n  * the `templateId` property: This filter only allows the equal to operator (`==`), and only one template ID can be included.\n Example: `templateId=3e61c592-05de-422e-99be-24712c07fc29`\n * the `templateName` property: This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`), and only one templateName can be included.\n Example: `templateName~sample-template-name` \n * The `client` property. This filter only allows the `==` equal to operator, and only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n Example: `client==API`\n * The `scheduleId` and `scheduleRunId` properties. These filters only allow the `==` equal to operator.\n Example: `scheduleId==bWFudWFsX18yMDE4LTEwLTEyVDA0OjM2OjE5LjkzNzI2Nw==,scheduleRunId==manual__2018-10-12T05:11:40.816520`\n Example of a complex search with multiple filters:\n  * Get me queries that utilize two specific datasets, submitted by a particular user, and that include the string `SELECT c1` in the SQL body: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff,userId=1234@AdobeId,sql~SELECTc1`",

The examples below are given with unsafe HTML characters for clarity, but all content MUST be HTML escaped.\n\nThe following list of properties allow filtering with all operators: `created`, `updated`, `state`, `id`.\n\nThe following is a list of supported operators: `>` (greater than) `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to) `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `~` (contains)\n\nExamples with filters that support all operators:\n  * Get query with a match on id:\n  `id==6ebd9c2d-494d-425a-aa91-24033f3abeec`\n  * Get queries created after a given timestamp, and with a specific state:\n  `created>=2017-04-05T13:30:00Z,state==IN_PROGRESS`\n Filtering is also allowed with limited operators on the following properties:\n * The `referenced_datasets` and `userId` property. This filter only allows the `==` equal to operator, and up to 10 dataset IDs can be included by using the `||` logical OR operator. \n  Example: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff`\n * The SQL property. This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`), and only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n  Example: `sql~SELECT c1`\n  * the `templateId` property: This filter only allows the equal to operator (`==`), and only one template ID can be included.\n Example: `templateId=3e61c592-05de-422e-99be-24712c07fc29`\n * the `templateName` property: This filter only allows the contains operator (`~`), and only one templateName can be included.\n Example: `templateName~sample-template-name` \n * The `client` property. This filter only allows the `==` equal to operator, and only one SQL string WITHOUT a comma (`,`) can be included.\n Example: `client==API`\n * The `scheduleId` and `scheduleRunId` properties. These filters only allow the `==` equal to operator.\n Example: `scheduleId==bWFudWFsX18yMDE4LTEwLTEyVDA0OjM2OjE5LjkzNzI2Nw==,scheduleRunId==manual__2018-10-12T05:11:40.816520`\n Example of a complex search with multiple filters:\n  * Get me queries that utilize two specific datasets, submitted by a particular user, and that include the string `SELECT c1` in the SQL body: `referenced_datasets==aabbcc||ddeeff,userId=1234@AdobeId,sql~SELECTc1`",

With this serverless tool, you can join any datasets in the [Experience Platform Data Lake](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/license/data-management-best-practices.html#understanding-adobe-experience-platform-data-storage) and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-time Customer Profile.\n\n**Related Documentation**:\n  * [Query Service documentation](http://www.adobe.com/go/query-service-home-en)\n\n**Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software)**:\n  * [Query Service API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Query%20Service%20API.postman_collection.json)\n  * [Video guide for creating the Postman environment](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28832)\n  * [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/using_environments_in_collection_runs/)\n\n**API paths**:\n  * PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/\n  * Base path for this API: /data/foundation/query\n  * Example of a complete path: https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/query/queries\n\n**Required headers**:\n  * All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).\n  * All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, \"prod\"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.\n  * All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.\n\n**API error handling**:\n  * Refer to the Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide for [FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#faq), [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#api-status-codes), and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#request-header-errors).\n  * Refer to the Query Service troubleshooting guide for [common query related FAQs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/query/troubleshooting-guide.html).",
